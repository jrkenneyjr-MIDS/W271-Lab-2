#SECTION - 4 FINAL REMARKS
. Section 4: Final Remarks. After examining the data and using the data to build a predictive model,
what are your departing thoughts? What are the strengths and weaknesses in your analysis? Should
the administration trust your result? Are there subsample in your sample that your model did a bad
job in predicting their contribution behavior? If so, why? Are there other "things", a wish list, that you
think can be used to improve your model? If so, what are they? Perhaps you can make a suggestion to
the administration to collect those information in the future.
